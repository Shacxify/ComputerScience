# Lab 1 (Elevens)

The Elevens lab is the second of the four (current) AP Computer Science labs we will be completing.

Major topics in this lab include use of classes, methods, and ArrayLists.

We will be using the AP Lab guide which includes directions for adding to the pre-existing code and questions for you to answer.

You will upload your .java files for each activity as usual and upload your answers to questions as either a Google Doc or Word document.
